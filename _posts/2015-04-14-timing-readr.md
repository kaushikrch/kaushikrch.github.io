Recently, [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) announced the release of [readr package v0.1.0](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/). Having been written using [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html), this package claims to read tabular data into R in a fast and friendly manner. 


```r
install.packages("readr")
```

```
## Installing package into 'C:/Users/k.roy.chowdhury/Documents/R/win-library/3.1'
## (as 'lib' is unspecified)
```

```
## package 'readr' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
## 
## The downloaded binary packages are in
## 	C:\Users\k.roy.chowdhury\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp6NxuOR\downloaded_packages
```

```r
library(readr)
```
